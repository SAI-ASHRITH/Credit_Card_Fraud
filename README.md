Analysis of Credit card fraud detection using data mining and visualization techniques

## Problem Statement:

With the advent of modernization, the advancement of technology in our everyday life has exponentially increased. In the finance sector
with the introduction of credit cards, sales and purchases of goods has become easy and convenient. Everyone nowadays has his own 
credit card. While some people use technology for the betterment of society, there are others who use it for their own personal good. 
Similarly is the case of credit cards. Identity thefts and fraudulent transactions are very common forms of credit card fraud. 
Even with many strict and complex security measures taken, people always find a way to trick the security into making them think
it is a validated access. Thus, many financial establishments have turned to machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide 
with an efficient and cost effective solution for this unending problem. Our project is to implement and analyse these solutions and 
come up with an estimate of which solution is better suited for this problem.

## Dataset:

The dataset used for the analysis of credit card detection in this paper contains data from European credit card holders 
consisting of rows of transactions made by credit cards. The total number of transactions captured were 500,000 and the number of features
captured were 320. Data preprocessing was done to drop the missing values. Principal component analysis was done to determine the most 
relevant features. The result of data preprocessing yielded 284,807 records and 31 most prominent features were chosen. The features 
included 28 masked features which are intentionally masked by the data source, and ‘time’ and ‘amount’ of the transaction.

## Data Preprocessing:

Techniques used in Data Preprocessing

1. Data Cleaning
2. Memory Reduction
3. Under Sampling
4. Dimensionality Reduction
5.Feature Selection
6. Outlier detection
